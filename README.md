# Aatmanirbhar Samakraman
This project is a real-world application based on the technologies learned while implementing [Aatmanirbhar Sanchar](https://github.com/JayJhaveri1906/Aatmanirbhar-Sanchar) mixed with newer technologies.

### Tata Institute of Fundamental Research gave my team the Problem Statement:
Imagine a radiation engineer wearing protective equipment handling a radiation detection device in a remote place. This radiation equipment constantly measures the radiation readings and then stores these logs/files on the radiation engineer's android phone. Our task is to automate the process of backing up these files securely into a cloud server as soon as possible and store the backup for reference locally. In other words, We should constantly monitor a selected storage directory, queue up any files entering that directory for upload, and then back it up in a different directory.

Further, we improved upon this PS by introducing real time tracking of the uploaded files, and inturn the engineer on to a website. While queuing up the files for upload, the gps location of the phone and the internet location (Which ever is available) is also stored and uploaded.
Our sister application: [Map Tracking for Auto Sync App](https://github.com/JayJhaveri1906/Map-Tracking-for-Auto-Sync-App) handles this on the server end.


Rest of the server is managed by our second sister code base developed in python: [Server Code Base](https://github.com/JayJhaveri1906/Auto-File-Sync-App-Server)
