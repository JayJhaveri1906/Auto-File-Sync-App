# Aatmanirbhar Samakraman
This project is a real-world application based on the technologies learned while implementing Aatmanirbhar Sanchar mixed with newer technologies.

Tata Institute of Fundamental Research gave my team the Problem Statement: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine a radiation engineer wearing protective equipment handling a radiation detection device in a remote place. This radiation equipment constantly measures the radiation readings and then stores these logs/files on the radiation engineer's android phone. Our task is to automate the process of backing up these files securely into a cloud server as soon as possible and store the backup for reference locally. In other words, We should constantly monitor a selected storage directory, queue up any files entering that directory for upload, and then back it up in a different directory.
